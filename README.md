## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Expense Splitting Algorithms

**Equal Split:**
- Automatically divides expense equally among all members

**Unequal Split:**
- Allows custom amounts for each member
- Validates total equals expense amount

**Share-based Split:**
- Distributes expense based on shares (e.g., 2:1:1)
- Calculates proportional amounts automatically

### Settlement Calculation

The app uses an optimized algorithm to minimize transactions:
1. Calculates net balance for each member
2. Identifies debtors (negative balance) and creditors (positive balance)
3. Matches debts with credits efficiently
4. Generates minimal settlement transactions

### Meal Tracking System

**Monthly Calculation:**
- Filters market/grocery expenses by month
- Counts total meals eaten in the month
- Calculates: `Cost Per Meal = Total Market Expense / Total Meals`
- Tracks individual meal counts and balances
